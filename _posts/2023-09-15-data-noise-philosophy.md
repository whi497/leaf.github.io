In my second year of doctoral research, I began to realize that cleaning data isn't just technical work—it's more like a process of reconstructing and refining the objective world.

## The Art of Data Cleaning

Every dataset tells a story, but that story is always corrupted by noise. Sensor errors, human mistakes, missing values, outliers—these are the static that obscures the signal.

When we clean data, we make choices. We decide what counts as noise and what counts as information. This is not a neutral act.

## Philosophical Implications

Consider: when we remove an "outlier," we're making a claim about what's normal. When we impute missing values, we're asserting what *should* have been there. These are metaphysical commitments dressed in statistical clothing.

The data scientist, whether they realize it or not, is engaged in a kind of philosophical practice. They're deciding what aspects of reality are worth preserving and which can be discarded.

## A Personal Reflection

I used to think my job was to find truth in data. Now I think it's more accurate to say I'm *constructing* a version of truth that's useful for particular purposes.

This isn't relativism—some constructions are better than others. But it's a humbling realization that even our most "objective" analyses are shaped by human judgment.

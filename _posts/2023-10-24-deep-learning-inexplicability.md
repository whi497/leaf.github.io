When we talk about black-box models, we're actually discussing a new form of empiricism. Data-driven decision-making may, in some sense, be a return to humanity's early intuitive cognition.

## The Black Box Problem

The challenge of interpretability in deep learning isn't merely technical—it's epistemological. We've built systems that work remarkably well, yet we struggle to articulate *why* they work.

This reminds me of how early humans navigated the world: through pattern recognition and intuition rather than formal reasoning. Perhaps neural networks, in their opaque complexity, mirror this ancient mode of understanding.

## A New Empiricism

The scientific revolution championed explanatory models. We wanted not just predictions, but understanding. Deep learning challenges this paradigm by delivering unprecedented predictive power without the traditional explanatory framework.

> The question isn't whether black boxes are useful—they clearly are. The question is whether useful predictions without understanding constitute knowledge.

## Moving Forward

As researchers, we face a choice: do we prioritize interpretability at the cost of performance, or do we accept that some forms of intelligence may be fundamentally opaque?

I don't have an answer yet. But I believe the question itself is worth exploring.

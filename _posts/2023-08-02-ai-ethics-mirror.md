Reflecting on the ethical alignment problem not as a coding bug, but as a sociological mirror reflecting our own biases.

## The Alignment Problem

Much ink has been spilled on aligning AI systems with human values. But this framing assumes we know what "human values" are—a premise that centuries of moral philosophy have failed to establish definitively.

## AI as Mirror

When an AI system exhibits bias, we often treat it as a technical failure. But more often, it's a faithful reflection of the data we fed it—data generated by biased humans operating in biased systems.

The uncomfortable truth is that AI doesn't create bias; it amplifies and reveals the bias that was already there. In this sense, AI systems serve as mirrors, showing us aspects of ourselves we might prefer not to see.

## What This Means for AI Ethics

If AI reflects human bias, then AI ethics cannot be divorced from human ethics. Technical solutions—debiasing algorithms, fairness constraints—are necessary but insufficient.

We need to ask harder questions:
- Whose values should AI systems encode?
- How do we handle genuine moral disagreement?
- Is it possible to build systems that are "fair" in any meaningful sense?

## A Path Forward

I don't believe there are easy answers here. But I do believe that engaging with these questions honestly—rather than treating ethics as a PR problem to be managed—is essential.

The AI systems we build will shape society for generations. We owe it to future generations to get this right, or at least to try.
